# Room Scanner Improvements

## ✅ Implemented: Obstacle Avoidance

The robot now has **intelligent obstacle detection**!

### Features Added:
- **Ultrasonic sensor integration** - Measures distance to obstacles
- **Automatic backup** - Backs away when too close (< 30cm)
- **Continuous monitoring** - Checks for obstacles while rotating
- **Adaptive behavior** - Tries alternate angles when blocked
- **Statistics tracking** - Reports obstacles detected and backup maneuvers

### How It Works:
```python
# Before each movement
if obstacle_detected:
    backup()
    try_different_angle()

# During rotation
while rotating:
    if obstacle_detected:
        stop()
        backup()
```

### Run It:
```bash
./SCAN_ROOM.sh
```

### Example Output:
```
--- 📍 Scan Position 3/8 ---
  🔄 Rotating to position 3...
  📏 Distance to nearest object: 25.3cm
  🛑 Obstacle at 25.3cm - adjusting position
  ⚠️  OBSTACLE DETECTED! Backing up...
  ✅ Backed away from obstacle
  🔄 Trying alternate rotation angle...

🏁 MISSION COMPLETE
📊 Mission Statistics:
  🛡️  Obstacles detected: 3
  ⬅️  Backup maneuvers: 3
```

## 💡 Future Ideas

### 1. Phone-Based Room Mapping

**Your idea about using a phone is actually clever!** Here are ways to do it:

#### Option A: Pre-scan with Phone
1. **Use a 3D scanning app** on your phone:
   - iPhone: Built-in LiDAR Scanner app, Polycam, Canvas
   - Android: RoomScan, Magicplan, 3D Scanner App

2. **Export the scan** as:
   - Point cloud (.ply, .xyz)
   - 3D mesh (.obj, .stl)
   - Floor plan image

3. **Use it for path planning**:
   ```python
   # Load room layout
   room_map = load_phone_scan('my_room.ply')

   # Plan optimal scanning path
   waypoints = plan_coverage_path(room_map)

   # Robot follows the path
   for waypoint in waypoints:
       navigate_to(waypoint)
       scan_objects()
   ```

#### Option B: Phone as Remote Sensor
Mount your phone on the robot as an additional camera/sensor:
- Better camera quality
- More processing power
- GPS/IMU for positioning
- Stream data via WiFi

**Complexity**: Medium-High (requires path planning algorithms)

### 2. Vision-Based Obstacle Detection

Add AI models for better obstacle awareness:

#### MiDAS Depth Estimation
```python
from transformers import pipeline

depth_estimator = pipeline("depth-estimation", model="Intel/dpt-hybrid-midas")

# Get depth map from camera
depth = depth_estimator(frame)

# Check if path is clear
if depth[center_region].mean() < threshold:
    obstacle_ahead = True
```

#### YOLO for Obstacle Classification
Detect specific obstacles:
```python
# Detect "wall", "furniture", "person"
if "person" in detections:
    wait_for_person_to_move()
elif "table" in detections:
    navigate_around()
```

**Complexity**: Medium (just add model loading)

---

### 3. Advanced Navigation

#### A* Path Planning
Navigate around known obstacles intelligently:
```python
from pathfinding import AStarFinder

# Create occupancy grid
grid = Grid(width=100, height=100)
mark_obstacles(grid, detected_obstacles)

# Find path
path = AStarFinder().find_path(start, goal, grid)
```

#### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
Build a map while exploring:
- Use ORB-SLAM or similar
- Create persistent map
- Remember where you've been

**Complexity**: High (complex algorithms)

---

### 4. Multi-Room Scanning

Extend scanning to multiple rooms:
```python
rooms = ['living_room', 'bedroom', 'kitchen']

for room in rooms:
    navigate_to_room(room)
    scan_room()
    save_results(f'{room}_objects.json')
```

**Complexity**: Medium (needs doorway detection)

---

### 5. Object Localization

Map where each object is located:
```python
# Combine distance sensor + YOLO detections
object_positions = []

for detection in yolo_results:
    distance = get_distance()
    angle = current_robot_angle

    # Calculate position
    x, y = polar_to_cartesian(distance, angle)
    object_positions.append({
        'type': detection.class_name,
        'position': (x, y)
    })

# Generate top-down map
plot_room_map(object_positions)
```

**Complexity**: Medium (trigonometry + visualization)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

**Easy wins** (do these first):
1. ✅ **Obstacle avoidance** - DONE!
2. **Adjust obstacle distance** - Change `obstacle_distance=30` parameter
3. **Longer scanning time** - Increase `pause_duration=3.0`
4. **More positions** - Try `scan_positions=12` for finer coverage

**Medium difficulty**:
1. **Add depth estimation** - Use MiDAS model
2. **Object position mapping** - Calculate where objects are
3. **Save scan results** - Export to JSON file

**Advanced projects**:
1. **Phone-based room mapping** - Pre-scan with phone, use for navigation
2. **SLAM integration** - Build persistent maps
3. **Multi-room missions** - Scan entire house

## 📱 Phone Scanning - Detailed Guide

### Method 1: LiDAR Scanning (iPhone Pro)

1. **Scan your room**:
   ```
   - Open "3D Scanner App" or "Polycam"
   - Walk around room slowly
   - App captures 3D model
   ```

2. **Export the scan**:
   - Export as PLY or OBJ format
   - Transfer to Pi via AirDrop/email

3. **Use in Python**:
   ```python
   import open3d as o3d

   # Load point cloud
   pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("room_scan.ply")

   # Extract floor plan
   floor_points = extract_floor_plane(pcd)
   obstacles = extract_obstacles(pcd)

   # Plan path
   path = plan_collision_free_path(obstacles)
   ```

### Method 2: Phone as Robot Camera

Mount phone on robot, stream via WiFi:

```python
# On phone: Use IP Webcam app
# On Pi:
import requests

phone_url = "http://192.168.1.100:8080/shot.jpg"

def get_phone_image():
    response = requests.get(phone_url)
    img_array = np.array(Image.open(io.BytesIO(response.content)))
    return img_array

# Use phone camera for YOLO
frame = get_phone_image()
results = yolo_model(frame)
```

**Pros**: Better camera, more processing power
**Cons**: Battery drain, need stable mount

## 🔧 Tuning the Current System

Adjust these parameters in the code:

```python
scanner = RoomScanner(
    scan_positions=8,        # More = finer coverage (try 12 or 16)
    pause_duration=2.0,      # Longer = more detections (try 3.0)
    scan_speed=20,           # Slower = more stable (try 15)
    turn_angle=30,           # Sharper turns (try 35)
    confidence_threshold=0.6, # Lower = more detections (try 0.5)
    obstacle_distance=30     # Safety margin in cm (try 40)
)
```

Try this for thorough scanning:
```bash
# Edit room_scan_standalone.py, change to:
scan_positions=12         # Every 30 degrees
pause_duration=3.0       # 3 seconds per position
obstacle_distance=40     # Stop earlier
```

## Questions?

- **Robot still hits walls?** → Increase `obstacle_distance`
- **Too many false detections?** → Increase `confidence_threshold`
- **Want more coverage?** → Increase `scan_positions`
- **Robot moves too fast?** → Decrease `scan_speed`
